## Features

- **Customizable Buttons**: Assign different functions to each button on the landline.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple wiring and coding with Arduino Nano.
- **Open Source**: Modify and improve the project as you see fit.

## Requirements

- Arduino Nano
- Old BSNL Landline
- USB Cable
- Jumper Wires
- Soldering Kit (optional)

## Installation

1. **Disassemble the Landline**: Carefully open the landline and identify the buttons and their connections.
2. **Connect to Arduino**: Use jumper wires to connect the buttons to the Arduino Nano.
3. **Upload Code**: Write and upload the Arduino code to map the buttons to desired functions.
4. **Test and Debug**: Ensure all buttons are functioning as expected.

## Usage

Once set up, you can use the DialDeck to control various aspects of your stream, such as switching scenes, muting the microphone, and more.
